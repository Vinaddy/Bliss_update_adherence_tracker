# Bliss_update_adherence_tracker
This is a chrome plugin which automatically opens with Bliss and works only on bliss. The plugin creates a lock on the page which you can clear only if you've gone through the recent updates.

Instructions to install and use the Bliss update adherence plugin

Download and extract the package on your local drive
Open chrome://extension on your browser and enable developer mode
You can now see new fields on your extensions page
One of which should say ‘Load unpacked extensions’
Click on it and load the package from your local folder
Once done, toggle the enable button and you should now find the extension visible in your plugin tray
Please note that the plugin will not open on any other web page except for the Bliss page 
On all other web pages the plugin will appear disabled

The plugin essentially will hold a form that you have to complete. Once you’ve answered all the questions right, submit the form and minimize the window.
Closing the window will make it reload every time you refresh a Bliss page


Important: This is the link to edit the google form and is the only link you will need to use on a daily basis, once the installation is done.
